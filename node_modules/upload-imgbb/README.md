# Upload-imgbb

Upload-imgbb is a Node.js module that simplifies the process of uploading media files to imgbb.com and retrieving the uploaded link and related data. This module supports popular image formats such as jpg, jpeg, png, and gif. It utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests and Form-Data for handling form submissions.
